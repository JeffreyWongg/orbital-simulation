    "In this project, we'll implement a simple physics simulation of a planet orbiting another planet. One of the key challenges in simulating physics on a computer is that our world is _continuous_, but computers can only keep track of _discrete_ pieces of information. In other words, there's no way for a computer to produce a simulation that exactly matches reality. However, in many cases, a discrete approximation is good enough to get realistic behaviour, and we'll show this is indeed the case for a simple orbiting planet example!\n",

    "Our end goal is to know the position of our simulated planets at every point in time. Although this particular problem has a known equation for the solution (the Kepler problem), most problems in physics don't have an explicit equation describing their evolution. That's not to say we don't understand these problems at all - it just means we primarily understand them _indirectly_, through their derivatives. In fact, it's often easier to describe problems based on their derivatives. However, we're missing one more piece that will allow us to obtain trajectories from its derivatives: an _integrator_. These allow us to use position and velocity information at one point in time to make an estimate about the position and velocity at a future (nearby) point in time. In this project we'll discuss 3 different types of integrators.\n",
